The implementation of the font on the web should only be done with the @font-face attribute. We deliver the font only in woff format encoded in a css file. 

Steps to follow: 

	1.	Create a font folder at the root of your website. 
	2.	Link font/myfont.css in your main css file using @import 
		â€”> @import url('../font/myfont.css');
	3.	Call the font using "font-family" in your main css file as it is named inside the font's css file.
